GuacaBot
========

GuacaBot is a simple Node.js IRC bot with some commands and a web interface for watch the bot console output.
Also, it can be oriented to Minecraft Servers' IRC channels with the built-in Bukkit Flavours.


Features
--------
* Commands(mostly funny).
* **Anti-spam system** for commands.
* **Can be oriented to Minecraft Servers** with official IRC channels.
* Complete, simple-to-learn JSON **config**.
* Socket.io based **web interface** for watch console output **real-time**(pretty buggy, sorry).

Notes
--------
This is a project mostly made for fun. Don't think of this as a serious project, so don't send me thousands of hard-to-make ideas.
When sending one, provide some code for make your idea easier to implement oficially.
Don't blame me about the libraries that I'm using. This is just a project for learning Node.js.
Also, don't ask for a plugin system. That'll be implemented someday. But someday, not ASAP.
