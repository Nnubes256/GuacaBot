	    // Hello. This is a JSON file.
	    // Here, you can add your phrase/phrase collections for the !eatnacho command.
	    // If you know how JSON goes out, just learn the syntax and you're done for make phrases.
	    // Else, READ THIS FIRST:
	    // First, you need to know the syntax:
	    // 
	    // "{COLLECTION NAME}": {
	    //    "phrases":[
	    //        "{phrase1}", <-- ADD A COMMA BETWEEN EVERY PHRASE
	    //        "{phrase2}",
	    //        "{phrase3}"
	    //     ]
	    // }, <--- ADD THE COMMA AFTER THE BRACKET!
	    //
	    // The labels with {} need to be replaced with stuff. For example, {COLLECTION NAME} should be replaced with the collection name (without the {}).
	    // In "enabled", you must put true or false, WITHOUT the ".
	    // "{phrase1}","{phrase2}"... are the phrases separated by commas. They must be inside brackets, like in the syntax example.
	    //
	    // You can add "tags" that are replaced by the bot automaticly for variables
	    // The list of tags is:
	    //
	    // {RANDOMUSER} -- Replaced by a random user connected on the same channel where !eatnacho is called
	    //
	    // In the "basic" collection, you'll see how this is made:
	    "basic":{
	    	"phrases":[
	    	    "and nothing occurs.", 
	    	    "but the nacho eats him first.", 
	    	    "and the nacho blames {RANDOMUSER} for no reason.",
	    	    "and the nacho watches a movie about humans inside the stomach of him.",
	    	    "and the nacho becomes invsible."
	    	]
	    },
	    // Add more collections from here
	}
