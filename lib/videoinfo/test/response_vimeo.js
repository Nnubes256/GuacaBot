For a more comprehensive text, go to<br />\n<br />\nwww.staywithmeproject.com<br />\n<br />\nStay With Me documents the experiences of families that live with the realities of brain injury worldwide. The project is a work in progress and I am constantly working to expand it. Stay With Me aims to raise awareness of brain injury and its effect in family and social life. It also acknowledges the value of these experiences and wishes to share them with other families who may be facing similar situations.',
